# Liberator Manifest

## Mission Statement

Liberator exists to free software from proprietary platform captivity. We believe that code should be portable, modifiable, and truly owned by its creators.

## Core Principles

1. **Freedom of Code** - No platform should hold your work captive
2. **Transparency** - All extraction and analysis processes are open and auditable
3. **Portability** - Liberated code should run anywhere
4. **Open Source First** - Prefer open-source alternatives to proprietary services
5. **User Sovereignty** - You own your code, not the platform

## What Liberator Does

- ✅ Extracts complete projects from proprietary platforms
- ✅ Analyzes and reverse-engineers code structure
- ✅ Normalizes dependencies across package managers
- ✅ Generates portable, standard project structures
- ✅ Creates Docker configurations for easy deployment
- ✅ Documents everything for future maintainers
- ✅ Suggests open-source alternatives to proprietary services

## What Liberator Doesn't Do

- ❌ Violate terms of service (extracts only what you have access to)
- ❌ Steal proprietary code or intellectual property
- ❌ Break encryption or security measures
- ❌ Access platforms without proper authorization

## Supported Platforms

### Currently Supported
- Base44
- Replit
- Generic (fallback for unknown platforms)

### Planned Support
- CodeSandbox
- StackBlitz
- Glitch
- CodePen (exported projects)
- Any platform that locks code in proprietary formats

## Use Cases

1. **Migration** - Move from proprietary platform to self-hosted
2. **Backup** - Create portable backups of your work
3. **Audit** - Understand what dependencies and services your code uses
4. **Open Source** - Convert proprietary platform projects to open-source
5. **Education** - Learn how different platforms structure projects

## Ethical Guidelines

- Only extract projects you own or have permission to extract
- Respect intellectual property rights
- Use liberated code responsibly
- Contribute improvements back to the community
